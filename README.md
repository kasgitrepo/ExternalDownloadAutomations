**The AI System That Reverse-Engineers Viral Content (While You Sleep)
This n8n workflow found the formula behind viral TikToks**

Hey Everyone,

Ever wonder how some TikToks get 2 million views while yours get 47?

I just reverse-engineered something that made my jaw drop.

It's an n8n automation that monitors viral content across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook and creates step-by-step playbooks for recreating that success.

Here's What This Beast Actually Does:
üîç Multi-Platform Intelligence Gathering

Monitors 6 major social platforms through webhook triggers

Automatically scrapes content based on hashtags and competitor profiles

Filters TikTok content for 200K+ views before analysis

Tracks top performers across all platforms (1000+ engagement threshold)

üß† AI-Powered Content Analysis

Performs GPT-4O sentiment analysis on 15-20 comments per viral post

Extracts audience pain points and common questions

Scores content on 1-5 scales for sentiment and tool usefulness

Analyzes platform-specific engagement patterns

üìä Intelligent Data Processing

Removes duplicates based on previous workflow executions

Stores data in organized Airtable "Audience Intelligence" database

Tracks metrics: views, likes, shares, comments, saves, duration

Captures music trends, hashtags, and posting timestamps

üöÄ Viral Playbook Generation

Uses GPT-4O to create detailed HTML content blueprints

Generates platform-specific captions and hooks

Provides audience avatar breakdowns

Creates repurpose strategies across channels

Automatically uploads playbooks to Google Drive as formatted docs

The Part That Blew My Mind:
This system doesn't just collect data‚Äîit automatically creates Google Docs with complete viral content strategies.

Each AI-generated playbook includes:

Proven viral hooks that stop the scroll

Word-for-word video scripts

Platform-specific caption variations (TikTok & Instagram ready)

Target audience insights with age ranges and interests

Repurposing angles for maximum reach

Pro tips for execution

Real Example: It found a TikTok with 200K+ views, analyzed the top 15 comments for sentiment patterns, identified the emotional triggers, and generated a complete content blueprint with audience avatar and repurpose strategy.

Why This Changes Everything:
Instead of guessing what content will work, you're literally copying the blueprint from posts that already have millions of views.

It's like having a team of social media analysts working 24/7 to decode viral content patterns‚Äîexcept it costs nothing after setup.

The Technical Breakdown:
This n8n workflow uses:

12+ Apify actors for social media scraping

OpenAI integration for sentiment analysis and content generation

Airtable APIs for data management and deduplication

Google Drive integration for automated playbook creation

Webhook triggers for seamless automation

The workflow handles everything:

Error handling and retry logic

Rate limiting and API optimization

Duplicate prevention across executions

Multi-platform content formatting

Automated status tracking

Best part? Once you set it up, it runs completely hands-off.

You wake up to fresh viral content strategies delivered to your Google Drive, based on the latest high-performing posts in your niche.
